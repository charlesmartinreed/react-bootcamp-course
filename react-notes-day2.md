# Day 1 Recap

- We use 'props' to pass attributes between components and elements

# Component-level State

- A component is func or class that optionally takes input and returns an element
- Component level state requires you to use a class component, not a functional one
- Functional component returns the UI of the component
- Class component specifies the UI via the render method
